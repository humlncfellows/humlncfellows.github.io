  	<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'">Before I start any math homework, I always look at the wiki page for a particular definition or series of steps needed for a proof. You can find a bunch of different proofs, some of them thousands of years old, for most problems. The hard part is understanding which definitions to start from, and which proofs to read instead of skim. I think, in this way, that the Internet is already a sort of artificial intelligence. I can read any idea and reformulate it for my own purpose. If that reformulation is sufficiently interesting, I can put it on a blog or personal website for the world to read. The problem is that many things aren't sufficiently interesting and get posted anyway, so the real problem today is who to listen to. </p>

   	<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'">A leader is someone worth listening to. A leader is someone who has something to say. I don't mean anything to say. Plenty of people can do that. A few might have anything to say, yet charismatic enough to make you believe in their originality. That's a small handful of people that I certainly don't count myself in. I would just like to have an idea worth listening to. </p>

  	<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> If I'm at that point, I'm not sure I see it. There may be a difference between ideas that make for good conversation and for good history. I enjoy good history, as we all do. The people or heuristics we strive to emulate are based on those historical outliers, who were in turn usually built up from some archetype before them. At their very essence, all of those outliers sell us some vision of the world. Even the "screw the system" kind of figures. <i>Especially</i> the "screw the system" kind of figures. I think Bob Dylan or Gil Scott-Heron are worth listening to. They're still just as much built off the same thing they seem to rebel against, since they'd have nothing to rebel against, or would have to rebel against something else, if what existed did not exist. </p>

  	<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> For a long time, maybe even a bit unconsciously now, I modeled many of my aspirations off of people like my grandpa and Elon Musk (I realize that idolizing a billionaire is unfashionable, and his vision isn't without holes. I'm still inspired by his risk-taking in reinvesting all of his PayPal profits into Tesla and SpaceX. The chances of success in the car and aerospace industries are small against companies like Boeing, Ford, etc. That takes courage and vision). Though my grandpa isn't as prolific as Elon Musk, he's a highly successful entrepreneur himself and the reason why I pursued aviation, why I flew planes. I will start my own company some day because of his vision. Still, the future will be much worse if what I have to say is another reiteration of rockets or chemical engineering. In fact, if I did follow those paths, I wouldn't be like them at all, because my grandpa took his own path and won his own way. The only thing worth emulating in a leader is the idea of ambition, whatever that is. I don't mean working 100 hours a week. Ambition is knowing that you can be worth listening to (not necessarily that you <i>are</i> worth listening to). I asked my grandpa when he knew he "made it." For a business, I always assumed that meant getting big enough to roll over everyone or getting the big buyout from some company one day. He said he never did. I respect that. To be worthy of total attention, to be taken as a true master of something, requires constant self-overcoming and learning. That's also why there's a hint of sadness in that feeling. There is no "satisfaction." There is no "rest." </p>

  	<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> That's also a reason to listen to someone. There's a lot of risk and sacrifice required in giving yourself to an idea. You risk attaching yourself to the wrong idea, or being completely overcome by the pursuit of an idea. You also risk finding a right idea and succeeding. Malcolm X was right, a lot. It also made him a target.  </p>

  	<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> In such an abstract label as "being worthy of being listened to," there do seem to be some ineffable qualities. One is the relentless pursuit of change. Change is a value that's embedded in that restlessness I mentioned earlier. MLK's greatest work (besides his letters or speeches) is titled "Why We Can't Wait." I find myself respecting people who make change a conscious habit. The most relevant artists sound almost nothing like themselves on some albums, with some piece of them still there. They change their styles and sound, so much that it even alienates and angers their own fans sometimes. But it doesn't just happen. Change is brought out through experience. I've seen jokes about which drugs represent which phase of Beatles albums. Though I don't propose doing drugs as a way of change (in fact, following this idea seems to me to be a cliche), the attempt to see things differently is itself admirable in some way. A trip like Malcolm X's to Mecca, where he saw all sorts of people and truly learned the Koran in its totality can only be experienced, not theorized. I suppose that's why people do drugs, because it's so visceral, and doesn't cost the plane ticket to Mecca. Further embedded inside change is the value of risk-taking. In some way, the two are synonymous. It is risky to want to change, especially if you have it "good." Risk has a certain magnitude to it that change doesn't. Change can be incremental. Risk could entail a non-zero probability of total failure. Again, however, many of the ideas we take for granted were once so ambitious that not only did people overlook them, they actively opposed them. I argue that not a single idea that's changed the world in a permanent fashion hasn't encountered vitriol or danger. So risk is the stakes of the change. We get bored of movies when there's no urgency or real consequences to the conflict in the plot. Why should anyone care? The risk is what makes the story worth two hours of your time. This is why we disrespect politicians or news anchors on some level. They can say anything they want, and we expect them to do just that. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> Someone worth listening to, lastly, is also a sort of craftsman. I don't mean a a woodworking or blacksmithing kind of craft, although I suppose those could be worth a look at. I mean a person who takes their work seriously and refines their skills with deliberation. That sort of care gives rise to the stereotype of the old, wise Zen master--the kind of teacher that only grows wiser with age. I find a sort of serendipity with change in this sense. We all change. We all get older. At some level, though, we seem to find aging pitiful and sad. I think this feeling comes about from confusion with aging and consciousness. One happens to you; the other you bring about yourself. The people worth listening to have had some sort of rebirth happen many times in their life, and you never really find them to be "old." All that has changed is their role. People worth listening to see themselves in a greater context, part of a continuum. As the world changes, they change with it and bring their craftsmanship with them. There is still some genuine sense of themselves in their work.  We respect art, old buildings--cathedrals, castles. There is something sacred about them. They're not quite just objects. They are the sorts of things that make rethink my definition to include things. Why can't an object be worth listening to? Why not a temple or a city? I realize that classifying objects as leaders might seem deliberately eccentric. In the context of inspiration, or pieces of a leader, or "motivating a group towards a common goal," I see nothing contradictory with matter.  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> There is a sense of care and devotion to cultivating matter. Why else carry bricks up and down a treacherous flight of stairs for years but to create something lasting? One of my laments about my own physical condition was the nihilism that accompanied it. Nihilism, relativism are both sorts of destructive urges. I suppose there's some destructive urge in the ability to create; all great inventors, scientists, musicians, etc. put someone out of work (which is coincidentally part of the reason why pushback to new ideas is so consistent). I can't say that I know what I want to be heard on. I'm not sure wanting to be heard is even a good thing. Those who we listen to consistently seem to not intend to be heard in the magnitude or fashion they did. The best we can hope for is pursuit of that craft. To enjoy something for its own sake. That also seems to be the way to be best heard--in a genuine manner. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> Now, I do believe this romanticizes "passion." The idea that we're supposed to be monogamous with ideas or hobbies is antithetical to change itself. Of course, to get really good at something requires devotion, although in this specialized economy, where we might be told that it's economically efficient to produce only what we're best at, isn't a way I want to live. I suppose this is why I truly love mathematics (and statistics, although it is based upon math). I believe that it is the most rich language we possess. If you understand mathematics, you can understand physics, chaos, randomness, physical systems of things, systems of people, even abstract notions of meaning and consciousness and intelligence. I want to devote myself to these ideas because anything that tells us anything about those is worth hearing. It is worth exploring.  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'"> Thus, I am a bit saddened that my time in undergraduate is over. I am pursuing graduate school, on top of my desire to create a startup, to further my education in mathematics. I'm not sure what will happen, or who I will know in 50 years. I do know that the way to get ideas that are worth hearing, the kind that change yourself and others for the better, are obtained by genuine curiosity and a desire to learn and change. I will pursue whatever will help me learn the most about myself. In that sense, I feel a sort of delightful omniscience in that anything that happens will be a gift. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier'">Don Draper of "Mad Men" is a character that I strive to emulate, as one can only dream of having such wanton hubris as to consistently cheat on his wife and have self-destructive tendencies. But his character has a great quote: "If you don't like what's being said, change the conversation." College, Fellows has taught me that I can be someone worth listening to, and to change the conversation. Thank you to my classmates, and thanks Sydney!</p>
